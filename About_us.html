        <!-- FLying Circus Aircraft Core rulebook by Erika Chappel -->

            <h1>What is Flying Circus?</h1>
            <p><em>“Flying Circus is a roleplaying game about the fantasy and reality of being
                    a flying ace in the days of early air combat. Over the course of the game,
                    players will take their ramshackle aircraft into battle, find triumph and
                    defeat, get blackout drunk [...] and
                    find a way to somehow pay for it all. They will be heroes and scoundrels,
                    knights errant and killers for hire, and they just might find out who they
                    are and where they belong, if they don’t crash and burn first”

                    “Central to the experience is daring air warfare in a free-form environment,
                    without maps or miniatures, constrained instead by air speed and altitude.
                    The game models the behaviors and characteristics of early aircraft in
                    detail, both fictional and historical models, and is paired with a complex
                    and highly detailed aircraft construction system.”</em>

            </figure>


            <p>The game draws heavily from the beauty of Miyazaki, the Grimm terror of pre-ww2 German folklore and the
                absolute jankiness of early aviation - all of this packaged in a lovely inclusive, queer package.
                This game isn't just about daring hijinks in rickety old planes, It's also about love, hate, trust,
                betrayal, and a world healing from war.
                These are all things that I am obsessed with, so when it came time to pick a subject to make a website
                about, it was pretty obvious to me that I wanted to do something with this hidden gem of a game.

            <p>Flying Circus has a special place in my heart because ever since I could remember, I've had a love for
                all things aviation that I, to this day, struggle to put into words. This game encapsulates that so well
                - it makes me feel that little bit less alone in the world. (Now if only I could get my friends to play
                it).

            <p><strong>Why Markgraf specifically?</strong></p>
            <p>I just like the Bristol F.2 (the Plane the Markgraf Zerstörer B is based on) - That's it. They are
                irrelevant otherwise
