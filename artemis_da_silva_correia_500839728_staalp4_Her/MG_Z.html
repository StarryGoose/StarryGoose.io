            <h2>Markgraf Zerstörer B</h2>
            <p>The Markgraf Zerstörer was designed as a unique
                multirole aircraft, to fit the divergent doctrine of
                the Königliche Sopwith Fliegerkorps. Neither fully
                an observer, a bomber, or a fighter, these aircraft
                were truly flexible, expected to operate without
                escorts after Attentäter scouts secured the skies.
            </p>

            <p>At the core of this remarkable aircraft was a V12
                engine, which gave the aircraft speed competitive
                with single-seaters despite its bulk. It was also
                given a highly modular armament, capable of
                carrying a large number of bombs and a variety of
                weapons for both the pilot and gunner position to
                fill any role. It could even mount cameras!
            </p>
            <p><strong>Common Variations</strong></p>
            <p>Many nations tried to copy the machine with varied
                results, and post-War, the Sopwith government
                sold off much of their reserve stock. This makes
                the Zerstörer a common sight in the skies.
